# Gradient-to-Gradient
Transforms the slope of the directional derivative and the direction of the gradient into a visual form that consists of horizontal stripes on a canvas with the color determined by the previous values corresponding value on a color wheel. Uses the Tkinter UI that allows the user to manipulate x and y values, three different three dimentional equations and the corrisponding a, b, and c constants, and the step size between each x and y value.

# Board-Game-Generator
Generates a board game with a unique set of rules, pieces and game board from user imput or from randomly generated imput. It displays a visual of the game and the rules as well as saving a document of the rules and game specs in a text document. The file where these documents are saved is created in the same directory as the program if it does not exist already. 

# Guess-the-Color
When run randomly chooses a number between 1 and 500. The user manipulates the slider which causes the canvas to change color going from red (farthest) to green (closest) depending how close the number on the slider is to the number randomly chosen. It displays a message on the canvas when the number is found.
