# Gradient-to-Gradient
Transforms the slope of the directional derivative and the direction of the gradient into a visual form that consists of horizontal stripes on a canvas with the color determined by the previous values corresponding value on a color wheel. Uses the Tkinter UI that allows the user to manipulate x and y values, three different three-dimensional equations and the corresponding a, b, and c constants, and the step size between each x and y value.

# Board-Game-Generator
Generates a board game with a unique set of rules, pieces and game board from user input or randomly generated input. It displays a visual of the game and the rules as well as saving a document of the rules and game specs in a text document. The file where these documents are saved is created in the same directory as the program if it does not exist already. 

# Guess-the-Color
When run randomly chooses a number between 1 and 500. The user manipulates the slider which causes the canvas to change color going from red (farthest) to green (closest) depending on how close the number on the slider is to the number randomly chosen. It displays a message on the canvas when the number is found.

# Border-Images
Takes images in a specified directory and adds a border that is half transparent and half a color of the users choice and the users choice of width. The program creates a file in that directory and saves the new images as JPEG images. Uses PIL.

# Team15
Team 15 was a program written to run in a 'Prisoners Dilemma' tournament in my APCSP class. The program takes the move history and score and compares the point gain with each choice and compares these ratios of 'betray' and 'collaborate' to make the next choice. The first choice is random. The only original code from me is from lines 16-40. Everything else was already written so the program could be run classwide.
