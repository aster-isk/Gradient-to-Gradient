# Gradient-to-Gradient
Transforms the slope of the directional derivative and the direction of the gradient into a visual form that consists of horizontal stripes on a canvas with the color determined by the previous values corresponding value on a color wheel. Uses the Tkinter UI that allows the user to manipulate x and y values, three different three dimentional equations and the corrisponding a, b, and c constants, and the step size between each x and y value.

# Board-Game-Generator
Generates a board game with a unique set of rules, pieces and game board from user imput or from randomly generated imput. It displays a visual of the game and the rules as well as saving a document of the rules and game specs in a text document. The file where these documents are saved is created in the same directory as the program if it does not exist already.
